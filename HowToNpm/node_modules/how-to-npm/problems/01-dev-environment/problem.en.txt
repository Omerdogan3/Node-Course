One of the most important things that npm does is install packages.

However, in order to be a good workshop program, we don't want to litter
files all over your computer, so before going any further, let's set up a
development environment.

First, make a new directory and `cd` into it.

Then, run `npm init` to create a package.json file. You will be prompted
to answer a number of questions. You can just press enter to accept the
default for each question.

Run `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify` once you're done.  All the other commands
you run in this tutorial should be done in that folder.
