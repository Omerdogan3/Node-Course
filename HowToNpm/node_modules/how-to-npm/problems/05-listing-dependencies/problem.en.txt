npm isn't just for installing stuff.  It also shows you what you
have installed (your dependencies).

You can do this using the `npm ls` command.

Run this command in your working dir.  If there are
any problems npm will alert you by returning an "!ERR" message.

If everything looks ok, then run `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify OK`, or
`$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify NOT OK` if npm does report a problem".
