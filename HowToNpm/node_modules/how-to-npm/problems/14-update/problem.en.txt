It's fine, of course, to explicitly check for outdated modules,
and then run `npm install` to pull them in.

However, if you want to be a bit more lazy about it, there's a special
npm command that will UPDATE all of your deps to the max version you
allow in your package.json.

Can you guess what command that might be?  (`npm help` might help you)

Update all your deps to the latest version possible, and then
run `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify` to pick up your delicious green banner.
