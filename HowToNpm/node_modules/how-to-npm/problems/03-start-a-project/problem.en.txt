npm helps you build projects, but for npm to be able to do that, you need
to tell npm a little bit about your project. You can tell npm about your
project in a file called package.json.

Run `npm init --scope=<username>`, and replace <username> with the user
you created in the last lesson. This will create a package.json file.
(For extra credit, set the project up with a git repo as well.)

Run `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify` once you're done.
